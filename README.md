Usage
-----

Right now it doesn't do much, but if you run `gobot.bat` you'll get yourself a little chatbot. Use the command 'reload' to exit the bot and allow the batch file to reload it with your code changes.

### Commands

__Help__

Shows some handy help.

__Reload__

Quits the bot. A wrapper can be written (gobot) that could restart the bot with new code.

__Joke__

Tells a funny joke. This will be the first test of the command json, right now it's hard-coded.
